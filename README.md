# My Písnička 2.0

Tool for learning guitar songs and playing them together with friends.

For me, people I choose and all our friends.

Display songs with chords. Auto-scroll them as you play. Share in Sessions with others. Vote in Session on next songs to be played.

Sessions are representations of real-time meetings. App doesn't play or store music.
